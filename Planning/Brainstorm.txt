Climate change:
-Too much Co2
  -Lack of trees
  -Fossil fuels (cars)
  -Production of food
  -Industries
-Possible solutions to above problems
  1. Device to plant and water tree in yard without much manual labor (more people may want to plant trees this way)
  2. Daily planner with a CO2 tracker (transportation, food, online products, and many daily activities can increase CO2)

Health:
-Movement issues
  -Permanent/long term injuries
  -Lack of physical activity
  -Bad food consumption
-Lack of vision
  -Genetics
  -Eye strain from screens (especially due to covid)
-Cancer
  -Mutations / genetics
  -Can be slowed down in early stages
-Possible solutions to above problems
  3. App to monitor screen usage and person's blinking (people often blink less on screens and eyes worsen)
  4. Phone app + earbuds to help blind person navigate on their own (if a person with loss of vision doesn't want a guide when going out)

Determining which solution to attempt
1. Tough to implement and requires hardware I don't have - No
2. Lot's of research for CO2 emission (Desktop and/or Mobile app) - Maybe
3. Use timers and python opencv for face detection to check if user there (Desktop app) - Most interested in
4. Tough to implement and can cause accidents if something goes wrong - No
